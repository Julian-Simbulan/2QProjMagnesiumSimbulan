					<p style = "text-align:justify">Iron golems are large powerful defending mobs found in villages or made by players. They are built by making a T-shaped structure out of iron blocks, then placing a carved pumpkin on top of it. In villages, they patrol the village, offer poppies to villagers, and attack hostile mobs and players that hurt them or the villagers. Outside villages, they wonder randomly, killing hostile mobs nearby. When attacking, they swing their arms up, causing large amounts of damage and their target being flung upwards.</p>

They are made by making a 2-high tower out of snow blocks, then placing a carved pumpkin on top of it. They walk around producing snow along their path, avoid many hazards, and melt in warm biomes and contact with water. They aggravate nearby non-animal neutral and hostile mobs by throwing snowballs at them until the target is dead or out of range. They are most effective against blazes, who get hurt from the snowball thrown against them.</p>
