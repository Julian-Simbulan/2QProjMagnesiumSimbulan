					<p style = "text-align:justify">The ender dragon is a giant dragon found in the End dimension, and is often considered as the end-goal of Minecraft playthroughs. She randomly flies around the middle of the main End island, being healed by 10 end crystals on top of obsidian towers, and destroying any block along her way that is not bedrock, obsidian, iron bars nor end stone. She deals different types of attacks, like flicking the player up a few dozen blocks, shooting fireballs with lingering damage, breathing out a deadly purple cloud, and flapping her wings to knockback nearby mobs. Once defeated for the first time, the bedrock structure in the middle opens, which upon entering plays a cutscene and teleports the player to the Overworld. She can be resummoned to be defeated another time. Everytime she dies, an end gateway portal appears near the edge of the End island.</p>
					<p>Spawn Conditions: initially spawned in the End; resummoned by placing 4 end crystals on the edges of the bedrock structure</p>
					<p>Health: 200 hp (100 x <img src = "../images/icons/normal.png" class = "heart">)</p>

					<p style = "text-align:justify">The wither boss is a large 3-headed mob that can be summoned anywhere by building a T-shape with soul sand and placing 3 wither skeleton skulls above the T. Upon being summoned, the wither is immune to damage for a few seconds, before exploding and being active. It is immune to fire and drowning damage, actively kills all nearby mobs except undead mobs and ghasts by shooting skulls at them, and break any block it flies through except obsidian and bedrock. When the wither's health is below 50%, it also becomes immune to projectiles. Upon dying it drops a nether star, a useful item that can only be obtained from the wither.</p>
